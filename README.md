# Webpage_Screensaver
*Note: In Progress*

Goal: Create screensaver program that displays a favorite website, and updates iteratively. Ideal for 
news sites, stocks, Bitcoin, deal sites etc. Will display the site as a full-screen image, which is closed upon user activity
via mouse/keyboard.

Ideas: Integrate a ticker-style system to scroll headlines, prices, events.
